# eVoting Platform - Polling System

## Overview

This is a modern, responsive polling platform built with React, Express.js, and PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM. The application provides a complete voting system with real-time results, poll management, and secure vote tracking.

## ðŸš€ Current Status: PRODUCTION READY

**Milestone Complete**: Professional UI/UX enhancement with comprehensive voting features. The application is ready for production deployment with polished interface, real-time countdown timers, and responsive design across all devices.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Button styling preference: Primary buttons have red background with white text, hover to darker soft red background with red text and red border. Secondary buttons (Add Option, Cancel) have soft red background with red text and red border, hover to lighter red background for subtle interaction feedback. Badges use themed colors - red for Public/Private modes, green for Active status, orange for Ended status.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Management**: In-memory storage with planned PostgreSQL session store
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for polls and votes

### Database Schema
- **Polls Table**: Stores poll information (title, mode, options, vote counts)
- **Votes Table**: Tracks individual votes with poll ID, user ID, and option selection
- **Users Table**: Basic user management (currently minimal implementation)

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Navigation**: Mobile-responsive navigation with hamburger menu
- **Poll Management**: Create, view, and manage polls
- **Voting Interface**: Interactive voting with real-time updates
- **Results Display**: Charts and analytics for vote results
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library

### Backend Services
- **Poll Routes**: CRUD operations for polls
- **Vote Routes**: Vote submission and retrieval
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface (currently in-memory, designed for database)

### Authentication & Security
- **User Identification**: Mock user ID system (ready for real authentication)
- **Vote Validation**: One vote per user per poll
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for API request validation

## Data Flow

1. **Poll Creation**: User creates poll â†’ Frontend validates â†’ API stores poll in database
2. **Voting Process**: User selects option â†’ Frontend submits vote â†’ Backend validates and stores
3. **Results Display**: Frontend queries results â†’ Backend aggregates votes â†’ Real-time chart updates
4. **State Management**: React Query handles caching, invalidation, and optimistic updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `drizzle-kit push`

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)
- **REPL_ID**: Replit-specific environment detection

### Production Setup
- Single-command deployment: `npm run build && npm start`
- Database migrations handled automatically
- Static files served from Express in production
- Development mode includes hot reloading and error overlays

### Architecture Benefits
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript ensures data consistency
- **Real-time Updates**: React Query provides instant UI updates
- **Scalable Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM ready for production
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Reusability**: shadcn/ui provides consistent, accessible components

### Technical Considerations
- In-memory storage currently used for development (easily switchable to PostgreSQL)
- Mock authentication system ready for integration with real auth providers
- API designed for REST patterns with clear error handling
- Frontend optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences
